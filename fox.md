# Fox



Foxes are extremely adaptable - they can thrive in a variety of environments including in and around human habitats such as farms and suburban neighborhoods.
While they’re quite flexible, red foxes favor open spaces with available cover.
One important element of a fox’s environment is a nearby source of freshwater like a stream, creek or lake.
