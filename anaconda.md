# Anaconda



These anacondas are olive-green with dark oval spots along their spines and similar spots with yellow centers along their sides.
The scales on their belly are yellow and black. They also have two dark stripes from their eyes angling toward their jaws.
Their color and pattern provides camouflage, allowing them to blend in with the wet, dense vegetation of their habitat.

Green anacondas are well adapted to aquatic life. Their nose and eyes are located on the top of their heads to help them see and breathe while swimming in the water.
Anacondas that live in areas that flood seasonally must find water during the dry season or burrow into the mud.
