# Raven



A raven is any of several larger-bodied passerine bird species in the genus Corvus.
These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus.
There is no consistent distinction between crows and ravens.
Names are assigned to different species chiefly based on their size.
The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven; these are also the largest passerine species.
